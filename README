This Eclipse plugin (developped on Eclipse 3.7.1) is for Maven users who want to mark the target folders as derived resources.
The point is to filter the derived resources when searching for resources (with i.e. Ctrl+Shift+R). After a mvn clean, the target
folders are recreated, and the plugin will help to mark these new folders as derivated.
